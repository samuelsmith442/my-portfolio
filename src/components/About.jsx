              After years in the printing industry, I discovered a love for coding and web development. What started as curiosity quickly evolved into a passion that drove me to transition careers and pursue development full-time.

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Now, I'm focused on front-end development and Solidity for smart contracts, with a goal of building impactful, user-friendly dApps. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of blockchain technology and user experienceâ€”creating interfaces that make Web3 accessible to everyone.

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              My background in printing gave me a keen eye for design and attention to detail that I bring to every project. I believe that great code should not only function flawlessly but also create meaningful experiences for users.

              When I'm not coding, you'll find me cycling, gaming, or diving into the latest tech trends. I'm always looking to connect with like-minded developers and potential collaborators.
